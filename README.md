## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- This is submitted as part of Upgrad PGDCA assignment

## Conclusions
- Findings on the final model
- 	Final Training Accuracy : 82.29
- 	Final Validation Accuracy : 77.85

- The training accuracy and validation accuracy show the same tred
- The training loss and validation loss also show the same trend
- Significant improvements observed after Augmentation and handling class imbalance
